This is a test of uploading an image to Wordpress. Based on code written by Yihui Xie.

```{r setup}
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = WrapWordpressUpload, base.url = NULL) 
opts_chunk$set(fig.width=5, fig.height=5, cache=FALSE)
````

Now we write some code chunks in this markdown file:

```{r}
## a simple calculator
1+1
## boring random numbers
set.seed(123)
rnorm(5)
```

We can also produce plots which are uploaded to imgur.com:

```{r md-cars, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(hp, mpg, data=mtcars) 
```
